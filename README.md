# level-up

Level Up is an academic platform targeted at Students who are studying for NCEA examinations. As a former student who had experience with NCEA, and have tutored other students in certain NCEA subjects, I really saw the benefit of having somewhere that was a direct revision platform for students doing NCEA. There are multiple quiz applications, and study apps, but none specific to NCEA itself. I know that I would have really benefited from having something similar to this to help me when it came to studying for my exams. 

Students are able to access this site, select the NCEA Level they are studying, then have a choice to take a quiz from a subject of their choice (English, Mathematics, Science). This is ultimately to help them revising for their exams, with questions from NZQA examinations of past years. They will instantly recieve feedback, and be able to keep track of their progress and score from the subject quiz they chose.

# MVP:
- Students can access this site, input their name, level, and quiz subject choice.
- Based on their selection, they will be taken to the specific quiz (eg. Level 2 English). 
- Students will have the question appear, with 4 options to answer from. If they click on the correct answer, they will recieve instant     feedback letting them know they got the question correct. If they click on the incorrect answer they will recieve instant feedback,       letting them know what the correct answer was, and reasons for why they weren't correct.
- When students recieve feedback, they have the option to go to the next question, or be taken back to the beginning where they can change   their level, subject choice etc.

# Stretch Goals:
- Students can keep track of their score/progress in the subject and level of the quiz they completed.
- Students will have a log-in and profile page.
